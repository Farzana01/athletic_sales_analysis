# athletic_sales_analysis
This code will analyze which cities in the U.S. have sold the most athletic wear, particularly women's athletic footwear over two years. It will also determine which retailers had the greatest total sales of athletic foot wear. It will also determine which day of the week had the highest sales for women's athletic footwear.

I have paired with Marnie and Omar for the assignment. We worked on them individually and I have helped Marnie understand how to read code.
